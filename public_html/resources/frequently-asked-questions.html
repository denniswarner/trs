      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <hr class="anchorLink_hr"/>
      <p><strong class="greenText">What is Physical Therapy and when is it necessary to see  a Physical Therapist? </strong> <br />
        <br />
Physical Therapy is the use of scientific physical  procedures used in the treatment of patients with a disability, disease,  illness or injury to achieve and maintain functional rehabilitation and to  prevent malfunction or deformity. Treatments are designed to minimize residual  physical disability, to hasten convalescence, and to contribute to the  patient's comfort and well-being. Physical Therapy is prescribed by physicians  for patients with varied orthopedic, neurological, vascular, and respiratory  conditions, which may be the result of congenital malfunction; disability  acquired through disease or trauma/injury, or inherited dysfunction. </p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><strong class="greenText">What does a Physical Therapist do? </strong> <br />
        <br />
        Among the diagnostic tests used by the Physical Therapist  are manual muscle testing, electrical testing, perceptual and sensory testing,  and measurement of the range of motion of joints. Functional activity testing  is important in ascertaining patients' capabilities for performing the  necessary tasks of caring for themselves. In treating a patient, the Physical  Therapist may employ one or more of the following procedures: heat/ice  treatments, melted paraffin wax, infrared and ultraviolet lamps, ultrasonic  waves that produce heat internally, and the application of electric current to  generate heat in body tissues. One of the most important tasks of the Physical  Therapist is therapeutic exercise in various forms. It is used to increase  strength and endurance, to improve coordination, to improve functional movement  for activities of daily living, and to increase and maintain range of motion.  Gait training is practiced with the assistance of canes, crutches, walkers,  braces, and artificial limbs. Physical Therapy also uses massage, manual  therapy, bandaging, strapping, and application and removal of splints and  casts. Some physical therapists may further their education in research and  manual therapy through advanced degrees and post professional education. Manual  therapy is one of the most effective techniques used by physical therapists to  restore joint function and reduce pain. This can be performed in the form of  soft tissue mobilization, joint manipulation to the extremities and  mobilization of the spine. Physical Therapists also instruct patients and their  relatives in techniques of exercise and the use of prosthetic devices, such as  artificial limbs, and orthotic, or bracing devices. Physical therapists can use  their skills in industrial rehabilitation where they can rehabilitate and make  ergonomic recommendations to clients on the job site, as well as in the clinic  for the purpose of returning clients to previous functional status. </p>

        <strong class="greenText">What’s the Therapeutic Rehab Specialists difference?</strong> <br />
        <br />
        At Therapeutic Rehab Specialists, we specialize in solutions to clinical and industrial  rehab challenges. We work one-on-one with patients to develop individualized  treatment plans to best address each patient's medical situation, we provide  the best possible therapeutic treatment choosing from a full range of treatment  approaches including manual therapy, neuromuscular re-education, custom taping,  heat, cold, electrical stimulation, ultrasound, and exercise. We also work to  help educate patients about ways to improve and maintain their capacity to  function and to prevent future injury. Our primary aim is to work with our  patients to evaluate their injury and to provide them with quality treatment  and education to return them to maximal functioning and productive living as  quickly as possible. <br />
        If you think you, or someone you know, may benefit from our  Physical Therapy Programs, contact our office at 1 (813) 876 (TRS-1). We offer  free advice and/or assessments for any type of musculoskeletal injury or  disorder. Remember, whether injured on the job, at home, during a sporting  event or in an auto accident... get treated <strong>&quot;<em>the  TRS way!</em>&quot;</strong>      </p>

      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>What should I expect on my  first visit?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>On your first visit, your physical therapist will perform an  evaluation to determine what deficits and/or problems you have that can be  addressed in physical therapy. The evaluation involves a thorough history  followed by objective testing and measuring from which your physical therapist  will form an opinion on your condition and the appropriateness of therapy. A  treatment program will be developed aimed at resolving the problems identified  as well as to attain the goals set by the physical therapist in conjunction  with you and your physician.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>What types of treatment may I  receive?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>The treatment you receive in physical therapy will depend upon what  the physical therapist finds in the evaluation. Our treatment programs are  functionally oriented with a non-dependent therapeutic approach. We emphasize  mobilization, self-treatment, and therapeutic exercise to go right to the  structure and resolve the problem. We do not stress &quot;feel good&quot;  modalities, such as massage, ultrasound, heat, electrical stimulation, etc.,  which do little to address the underlying pathology and can cause patient  dependence. We do utilize modalities as needed to assist us with  anti-inflammatory effects, etc. in the acute phase of injury.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>How long will my visit last?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>Treatment time will vary according to what the physical therapist  finds in the evaluation. There is no specific time limit for physical therapy.  Whatever is found to be appropriate during the evaluation will become part of  the patient's program and the program will be updated as appropriate as the  patient improves. In general, physical therapy treatments last anywhere from 1  hour to 1 1/2 hour with somewhat longer time being necessary for this first  visit because of the evaluation.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>How is my progress measured?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>Your physical therapist will perform a meticulous evaluation,  quantifying and qualifying all the deficits and problems you are presenting  with, re-evaluation, and re-measurement to determine progress. You will be  re-evaluated on a periodic basis, the frequency of which will depend upon your  diagnosis as well as the chronicity of the problem. In general, your therapist  will write a weekly progress note to update your physician, and patients are re-evaluated  anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. Additionally, the therapist always needs to be  aware of follow-up visits with your physician as a re-evaluation will be  performed so that the physician can be updated at that time.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>How will you communicate with  my physician?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>The physical therapist will communicate with you physician most  commonly by written report. The physical therapist will send a complete written  report outlining the findings of their initial evaluation as well as their  assessment of the problem and an outline of the general treatment and frequency  with which they intend to see you. The physical or therapist will continue to  update your physician with written reports each time you are re-evaluated and  most specifically prior to your return to the physician. This is why it is so  important that you let your therapist know if you have an appointment with your  physician. Additionally, the therapist will, as they feel appropriate, contact  the physician by phone if they have a specific concern or question. At the end  of your treatment the physical therapist will send a follow- up report to your  physician with final information as to your status at the time of discharge  from physical therapy.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>Will I need follow-up or  maintenance care?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>Our goal at Therapeutic Rehab Specialists is to resolve your problem  completely so that you do not require continual follow-up or maintenance care.  There are some patients who do require follow-up care or re-assessment on a  periodic basis, but that will be discussed with you once you are in physical  therapy or at discharge. This is generally not the case.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>What if I need to return to  physical therapy?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>If you have a recurrent problem after your discharge from physical  therapy, how/if you will return to physical therapy will depend on a number of  factors. It would depend if it was a re-injury of the same specific problem,  how long it has been since you were last in physical therapy, how long it's  been since you saw the physician, and many other factors. In general, if you  are discharged from physical therapy and feel the need to return, you should  contact the physical therapist who treated you. They will review your chart and  call back to discuss with you what should be done, depending on the problem you  are having.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>When is the best time to start  physical therapy?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>In general starting physical therapy should be done as early as possible.  Initiating physical therapy early on will reduce the overall treatment time  that you will require by not allowing the problem to become chronic. If you are  in pain and/or you are in an acute state, your program will be modified  according to your signs and symptoms. What is done for you in physical therapy  depends on the clinical stage of your condition, not just the diagnosis. Therefore,  your care will be modified according to the signs and symptoms during the  acute, subacute, and chronic phases of your problem.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <hr size="1" width="90%" noshade="noshade" align="center" />
      </div>
      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>Is it OK to ask my doctor about  physical therapy?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>Absolutely. If you have a problem that you think can be helped with  physical therapy, feel free to give us a call. After discussing with you the  specific problem you present with, we can give you a better idea if it is  something that is treatable with physical therapy. You can also give your  doctor a call. If he is not sure, he is welcome to contact us as well. In  today's healthcare, if you feel physical therapy can be helpful to you, you  will need to stress your feelings to the doctor you are seeing.

      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>Will my insurance cover  physical therapy?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>Because of today's health care and the wide variety plans available,  although most insurance companies do cover physical therapy, what they cover  specifically varies greatly. Please review our insurance list on this web site  and if you have additional questions regarding your specific insurance give us  a call. If we are not a provider for your insurance company we also offer cash  discounts.</p>

      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>What should I wear?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>In general, wear comfortable clothing to physical therapy. If you  are presenting with a problem of your cervical spine, upper back or shoulders,  the therapist can provide you with a gown as needed to expose these areas for  treatment. If you are coming for a lower extremity problem, shorts are  important. You can bring whatever you like to wear with you if you need to  change here.</p>

      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>What should I bring with me?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>For your first visit you will need your insurance card, prescription,  and any paperwork that was sent to you that needed to be filled out. If you  have any operative reports, MRI or X-ray results, you may bring those as well.  Additionally, if you are utilizing any type of brace, splint, or crutches,  those should come with you.</p>

      <p><span class="greenText"><strong>What if I have an increase in  symptoms?</strong></span><strong><br />
        <br />
      </strong>If you have increased symptoms please call your physical therapist.  When you call the office, please be sure you explain to the office staff that  you are having an increase in symptoms. The office staff will pull your chart and  contact your therapist. They will be able to review the information and will  give you a call back that same day. After we discuss the case with you, we will  be able to give you guidelines as to what would be appropriate to reduce your  symptoms, whether you need to come in our office, or if you should contact or  follow-up with your physician. It is best to call us prior to calling your  physician as if a change in symptoms has occurred, it is important that we fax  the physician a report so that he can be up to date on your care when you see  him for a follow- up visit.</p>

      <p><strong class="greenText">Who chooses which physical  therapy center I go to?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Often your physician will give you a recommendation or a  listing of physical therapists in your area. Sometimes your insurance company  will guide you with regard to who is &quot;in network&quot; for your insurance  plan. Unless you are covered under workers compensation;  the decision as to where you receive your care is  totally up to you. If you have a specific request, you need to  let your physician or insurance company know. If we are not in network for your  insurance company most plans have out of network benefits which will allow you  your choice in physical therapy.</p>

        <br />
      </strong>We ask that our patients: Give 24 hours notice when possible for  cancellations; our voice mail or answering service is on 24 hours a day. Call  if you have a question or a concern or if you will be late. We will do our best  to fit you in but need to know in advance for consideration of other patients.  Be on time. All patients are taken within 5 minutes of their scheduled time.  Notify your physical therapist at least one week prior to returning to your  physician. The therapist must have this date in order to properly schedule a  re-evaluation for you to update your physician on your progress. Schedule  appointments in advance and have the proper number of visits scheduled. If you  don't schedule your appointments in advance it will be more difficult to give  you the times that you desire.</p>
